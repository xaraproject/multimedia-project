            It's true that the Greeks happened to be one of the most intelligent civilizations to ever exist. But who expected them to have invented the oldest known analogue computer, paving the way for many better creations to come?

            You're a sponge diver in 1900. As you dive in  the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera, you notice something. A strange pile.  You swim closer. You then realize: it's a shipwreck.

          <p class="paragraph">
            The Antikythera mechanism is a Greek mechanism that is noted as the oldest computer ever discovered. In this tiny machine, you can fill a library's worth of knowledge! You may see a lot of corroded metal, but in its prime, it was an extremely complex machine packed to the brim with tiny gears spinning around. This machine modeled the movements of the Sun and other celestial bodies with almost perfect accuracy. It was out of its league in Greece, and nothing like it would show up again until the first gear clocks were made.

                The Copper age (also known as the Chalcolithic period) was an era of humanity where they started to move on from stone, and more to metal. This resulted in a surge in technological discoveries around the world. Craftsmen used it to craft tools, pots, and more. Egyptians took it as far as making some of the oldest mirrors!
